New York CitiBike Data Visualisation is a web application to give users a visual representation of data obtained from
www.citibikenyc.com going back to July 2013. Users will be able to view heatmps of stations over time and to view graphs and
charts of data of their choice. The application is built using Python on the Flask micro-framework using Bokeh for the visualisation.
